# Sims4 to TU converter
 Automates the process of merging/renaming vertex groups to fit Tower Unite's armature
 
 It's my first ever Blender add-on, so it might be a bit janky, but it seems to work most of the time!

## How to install
* Download the **[Sims4_to_TU_converter.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lunarexxy/Sims4-to-TU-converter/main/Sims4_to_TU_converter.py)** file *(Right-click the page and Save As)*
* Open Blender
* Go to Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons
* Press the Install button and select the downloaded file
* Make sure the little tickbox next to the addon is checked, to enable it
* Hover over the 3D viewport and press N to pop out the sidebar
* If it succeeded, you should now have a "Sims 4" button in the sidebar. Click it to see what to do next.
