# Sims4 to Tower Unite converter
 Automates the process of merging/renaming vertex groups to fit Tower Unite's armature in Blender. It relies on the .dae models exported by [TS4-SimsRipper](https://github.com/thepancake1/TS4-SimRipper), so please use that! The settings I use when exporting are *"Solid and glass meshes and textures"* and *"Clean DAE mesh"*.
 
 *(i have no idea if .obj files would work too, never tried! Have fun being a pioneer if you want~)*
 
 Also keep in mind that Tower Unite currently has a [30,000 vertex limit.](https://towerunite.com/sdk/rules) If your model has more vertices than this, many players might not be able to see it in-game! Very detailed things, like modded clothes and hair, might push you over the limit, but the vanilla Sims 4 choices are usually okay.

## How to install
* Download the **[Sims4_to_TU_converter.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lunarexxy/Sims4-to-TU-converter/main/Sims4_to_TU_converter.py)** file *(Right-click the page and Save As, anywhere on your machine)*
* Open Blender
* Go to Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons
* Press the Install button and select the downloaded file
* Make sure the little box is checked, to the left of the addon name, to enable it
* Hover your cursor over the 3D viewport, and press N to pop out the sidebar
* If it succeeded, you should now have a "Sims 4" button in the sidebar. Click it to see what to do next.

This is my first Blender add-on, so it might be a bit janky, but it seems to work!
