# Sims 4 to Tower Unite converter
 This Blender script makes it easier to import Sims 4 models into Tower Unite, by automating the process of merging/renaming Sims 4 vertex groups to fit [Tower Unite's Blender Suite](https://forums.pixeltailgames.com/t/tower-unite-blender-tools-1-2-4/41541) armature.
 
 It relies on the .dae models exported by the [TS4-SimRipper](https://github.com/thepancake1/TS4-SimRipper), so please use that! See the image below for which settings to use. (An alternative version of the tool can be downloaded [here](https://modthesims.info/d/635720/ts4-simripper-classic-rip-sims-from-savegames-v3-13-0-0-7-12-22.html), in case the previous one doesn't work.)
 
 Keep in mind that Tower Unite currently has a [30,000 vertex limit](https://towerunite.com/sdk/rules) on uploading player models. The vanilla and DLC options from Sims 4 usually work fine, but modded content tends to push it over the limit. Tower Unite may also add vertices when importing, for some reason.

## How to install
* Download the latest **[Sims4_to_TU_converter.zip](https://github.com/Lunarexxy/Sims4-to-TU-converter/releases/tag/latest)** file
* Open Blender 2.80 or later *(last tested on 3.2.0, but will likely work on later versions too)*
* Go to Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons
* Press the Install button and select the downloaded .zip file
* Make sure the little box is checked, to the left of the addon name, to enable it
* Hover your cursor over the 3D viewport, and press N to pop out the sidebar
* If it succeeded, you should now have a "Sims 4" button in the sidebar. Click it to see what to do next.

## How to use the SimRipper tool

*(Requires Sims 4 to be installed on your machine, along with all the DLC and/or mods your Sim uses!)*

*(While "Single mesh and texture" is recommended, the other two options will also work. They just tend to require some extra effort.)*

## How to do everything else

[KikiTheGeeky](https://kikithegeeky.carrd.co/) has written [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QuYlJVm9N7VwhvK0ybf0UNh53gOLKEjAIN32H_VFBzE) showing how to put your Sims 4 model into Tower Unite using this tool! (Thank you!!)

I'm also planning on writing a more comprehensive guide to the process of rigging the Sims 4 models. It'll cover what I've learned so far, and how to fix common issues with the models. *(no promises i'll complete it because ADHD, but people keep being interested!)*

## Contributing
This is my first Blender add-on, so it might be a bit janky, but it seems to work!

Please report bugs and suggest improvements, if you have any ðŸ’–

## Big thanks to

*Lina*, for showing me the SimRipper tool, and being the first to ask if I could find out how import her Sim, which directly led to the creation of this script.

*Josh W*, for making a guide in 2018 on [how to import models into Tower Unite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYnYWDALONI) (I learned the essential steps from this)

*CmarNYC* and *thepancake1*, for creating and maintaining the [SimRipper](https://github.com/thepancake1/TS4-SimRipper) tool.

*Redoo*, *Skullasaurus*, *Laurie*, and others, for offering many different Sim models to learn from and practice on.

[*Kiki*](https://kikithegeeky.carrd.co/), for writing a [full guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QuYlJVm9N7VwhvK0ybf0UNh53gOLKEjAIN32H_VFBzE) on how to take the ripped models, fix them up, and import them into Tower Unite.
